The game has to be ran on local environment.
You have to serve database on localhost, user root, with empty password.
The game functionality is to line up at least 3 monsters in a horizontal line to make them disappear, then the score is increasing.
I am aware that the game has bugs, but the whole concept was made up in my mind from scratch and is constantly evolving with new things which I am learning/trying to learn.
